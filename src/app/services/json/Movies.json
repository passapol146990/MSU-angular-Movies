        "about":"Were super excited for Superman: Legacy, the first film in James Gunn and Peter Safrans DC Universe reboot and latest incarnation of the iconic hero. Departing from Zack Snyders darker interpretation, Gunn promises a Superman who is about kindness, love, and compassion ... the best of humanity, even though he is an alien from outer space. We can definitely get behind that. Legacy explores one of our favorite eras in Supermans history: Clark Kents early years as he tries to make sense of being a superhero on Earth â€“ though the planet already seems to have its fill of heroes, as weve spotted Hawkgirl, Mister Terrific, and Green Lantern in the trailers. With Frank Grillo set to reprise his role as Rick Flag Sr. from Creature Commandos, were hoping that more characters from the animated series might also be making the leap to live action.",
