    "detail": "You don’t need to be an anime fan or a gamer to appreciate the magic of Netflix's mega-hit “Arcane.” Based on the online multiplayer game “League of Legends,” the show is surprisingly accessible, with a gorgeous mix of 2D and 3D animation, compelling characters, and a rich narrative that tackles big ideas while staying grounded in human relationships. The first season won over critics and fans alike, scoring a 9.0 rating on IMDb and quietly winning a Primetime Emmy for Outstanding Animated Program. Season 2 finds conflict simmering between the “haves” of utopian city Piltover and the “have-nots” of the underground Zaun, but also between estranged sisters Jinx (Ella Purnell) and Vi (Hailee Steinfeld). Although the series concludes in this final season, Linke has teased there are more “League” stories to tell. ",

In 1995, author Gregory Maguire wrote the novel “Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West”, a revisionist origin story about Elphaba, the antagonist from Frank L. Buam’s “The Wizard of Oz.” Then in 2003, the popular book was adapted into a Broadway musical that focused on the complicated relationship between Elphaba and her school roommate Glinda. Now, director John M. Chu is bringing this beloved fantasy tale to the silver screen with a musical movie starring Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande as the bewitching duo whose passion, talents, and personalities bring them together before fate takes them down very different paths.",

If you're only a bit familiar with the lore, yes, Helm Hammerhand has a lot to do with Helm's Deep. And he was seen in statue form in The Two Towers. Since we're living in Tolkein Time, Gandalf, Galadriel, and others are alive, but they are not involved in this particular tale.

    "detail": "You don’t need to be an anime fan or a gamer to appreciate the magic of Netflix's mega-hit “Arcane.” Based on the online multiplayer game “League of Legends,” the show is surprisingly accessible, with a gorgeous mix of 2D and 3D animation, compelling characters, and a rich narrative that tackles big ideas while staying grounded in human relationships. The first season won over critics and fans alike, scoring a 9.0 rating on IMDb and quietly winning a Primetime Emmy for Outstanding Animated Program. Season 2 finds conflict simmering between the “haves” of utopian city Piltover and the “have-nots” of the underground Zaun, but also between estranged sisters Jinx (Ella Purnell) and Vi (Hailee Steinfeld). Although the series concludes in this final season, Linke has teased there are more “League” stories to tell. ",

Buam’s “The Wizard of Oz.” Then in 2003, the popular book was adapted into a Broadway musical that focused on the complicated relationship between Elphaba and her school roommate Glinda. Now, director John M. Chu is bringing this beloved fantasy tale to the silver screen with a musical movie starring Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande as the bewitching duo whose passion, talents, and personalities bring them together before fate takes them down very different paths.",

    "detail": "A footnote of a story told in J. R. R. Tolkein's novel gets forged into an animated movie from anime god Kenji Kamiyama, employing a visual style that will pay tribute to Peter Jackson's depiction of Middle-earth. The story reveals the history of the kingdom of Rohan and its then king, Helm Hammerhand, in his war with the Dunlendings, the wild men living on the fringes of the kingdom. If you're only a bit familiar with the lore, yes, Helm Hammerhand has a lot to do with Helm's Deep. And he was seen in statue form in The Two Towers. Since we're living in Tolkein Time, Gandalf, Galadriel, and others are alive, but they are not involved in this particular tale. However, we felt actual real emotions learning that Miranda Otto's Eowyn will narrate the story.",
